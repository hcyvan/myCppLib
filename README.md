# myCppLib
My c++ static library and head files

This repository is in building...

Now I want to create some python-like function. The name of these function are just like "basicnamepy". basicname is the function name in python.


The header and lib can be compiled by g++-4.9.2 and used on ubuntu11.01
g++ -std=c++11 filename.cc
